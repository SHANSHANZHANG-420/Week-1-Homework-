## Compound (Company) Case Study (Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies)

### Overview 

Compound was founded on 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Geoffrey Hayes and Robert Leshner are the founder of the company. Compound is an open-source interest rate protocol that unlocks new financial application for developers. In simple terms, Compound is a lending platform in the cryptocurrency market where people can use their crypto assets as collateral to take loan or lend assets to another people and gain a decent annal interest on their assets.  

Compound has raised 2 rounds funding. The first round has raised $8.2M from seed funding on 16 May 2018. Their latest funding has raised $25M on Nov 14, 2019 from series A funding (early-Stage Venture). Therefore, Compound has raised $33.2M fund in total. Moreover, Compound is funded by 11 investors. Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures are the most recent investors. According to PriveCo, Compound has a post-money valuation in the range of $100M to $500M as of Nov 14, 2019. 


### Business Activities 

Basically, Compoundâ€™s protocol is a series of open-source smart contracts that algorithmically adjust the interest rates for each asset in real-time, as borrowing demand for the asset changes. Compound supports the borrowing and lending of specific set of crypotocurrencies, including: Dai (DAI), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Ox (ZRX), Tether (USDT), Wrapped BTC (WBTC), and Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and Sai (SAI). However, Compound has create their own token - cTokens (**technology - cToken**) CTokens are created from Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens and are one of the great benefits and innovations of a blockchain-based crypto money market; people can be transferred, traded, or programmed into other Dapps in the DeFi ecosystem similar to other Ethereum tokens, all while earning (or paying) interest. people can transfer cTokens by using theri public and private keys.

Each asset supported by the Compound Protocol is integrated through a cToken contract, which is an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol. By minting cTokens, users(A) earns interest through the cToken's exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset, and user(B) gains the ability to use cTokens as collateral.



#### Clients, Competitor

The people who want to borrow cryptocurrency or stacking their cryptocurrency to earn APY (annual interest rate) could be the potential client of Compound. So far, Compound Finance has more than 8 billion of total supply and 3 billion of total borrow. Competitors of Compound include Gromor, Paststat, ToneTag and Pennyful.


#### Flash Loans in DeFi

In 2020, the heart of many losses in the DeFi space is suffering flash loan attack by attacker. Lenders on DeFi protocol Compound (company) has fallen victim to flash loans exploit, and the tune of over **$100 million**. 

Flash Loan is borrowing cryptocurrency to borrower without collateral, and the loan needs to be paid back in seconds. The borrower can call (create) smart contracts in that same transaction. If they can make more money through their loan, then they can return the money and pocket the profits in few seconds. However, flash loan attack is the attacker borrowing the cryptocurrency from the loan provider and pushing up the price of the stable coin temporarily to double its value, at the end they pay back the loan with it. Therefore, flash loan attack usually is the attacker stole money from a flash loan provider. However, this is the story of Compound flash loan attack.
